# SemantiCore

![Snapshot of user interface.](/.interface.png)

## Overview

Following repository hosts a program that implements a methodology for constructing thematic causal networks using artificial intelligence (AI) and automating their visualization processes. The methodology utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT as an AI tool for analyzing text data and establishing causal relationships between concepts. The resulting networks are visualized using Perl GraphViz library. This repository provides an efficient and accessible solution for conducting semantic analysis and is particularly relevant to fields like intelligence, investigation, journalism, analysis, and scientific research, with applications extending to diverse textual sources.



## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: The program leverages ChatGPT, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, to analyze text data and identify semantic entities and their causal relationships.

- **Automated Visualization**: The generated causal networks are seamlessly visualized using GraphViz library, facilitating in-depth analysis via .svg file format.

- **Quantitative Semantic Research**: The methodology focuses on creating clear and stable semantic relations between frequent and valuable entities, enabling quantitative semantic research.

- **Flexible Network Modeling**: The program constructs network models that adapt to pairs of semantic units, identifying interconnected causal relationships.


## Usage

1. **Data fed**: Feeding and preparing textual datasets or delegated web articles via proposed forms for further processing and gathering insights.

2. **Entity extraction**: Prepared data proceed to AI endpoint for entity recognition with defined queries to extract relevant semantic pairs.

3. **Visualization**: The generated semantic pairs are visualized using GraphViz, and the resulting network can be analyzed for insights.

4. **Interpretation**: Human interaction and expertise are essential to interpreting proposed results, ensuring reliability and accuracy.
